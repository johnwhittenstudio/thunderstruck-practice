  <p><h3>Thunderstruck Collective is a growing group of artists committed to collaborative engagements with the land arts of the American West through exhibitions and publications. Dr. Jessi DiTillio is a Los Angeles-based curator and writer who selects the artists in Thunderstruck based on a shared interest in exploring natural phenomena, the fallacy of human dominance and mastery over nature, and art’s ability to impact our understanding of land and space.</h3></p>

  <p><h3><em>Thunderstruck 2.0: black hole sun</em> is the second in a series of exhibitions inspired by journeys to classic land art sites in the American West. For this exhibition, three artists and one curator traveled to Western Utah to see Nancy Holt’s 1973-76 work <em>Sun Tunnels</em> on the Winter Solstice, shivering and windblown. For the Summer Solstice, the original four returned with three new companions, expanding the collective to seven artists, blasted by sand and sun. The artists participating in <em>Thunderstruck 2.0</em> bring diverse materials into their work--drawing, painting, photography, dirt, salt, magnetic waves, sound, light, and more--in order to transport viewers and offer an authentic sense of place. At the same time, <em>Thunderstruck 2.0</em> asks questions of the <em>Sun Tunnels</em>… How does this site frame our perception of light, scale, and emptiness? Who did Holt make this work for? What is the relationship between land art and spectacle?</h3><p>
